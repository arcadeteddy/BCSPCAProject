# Paws & Found

The BC Pet Registry was created in 2015 with the sole goal of reuniting more lost pets with their people. With over one million pets lost in Canada each year due to a lack of registered identification (ID), the program is more crucial than ever.
	
* Simplifies the search process
* Reunites companion animals to guardians faster than ever before

## Statistics

As loving and devoted pet owners, we rarely expect to lose a pet. Yet each year, more than 10 million pets go missing in North America and more than 75 percent never return home.
Approximately 95% of cats and 30% of dogs cannot be traced to their guardian. Not microchipped.

* Dog 8.2 million - 41% of households have at least one dog
* Cat 8.3 million - 38% of households have at least one cat 

According to these figures nearly 160,000 cats were lost or abandoned and ended up in shelters in 2016. The actual number is probably much higher, considering that not all strays ever make it into a shelter. Ten percent of those stray cats are reclaimed by their owners (By way of comparison, 68% of dogs in shelters are reclaimed by their owners.) That brings the number down to 144,000, or almost 400 new lost or abandoned cats every single day of the year.

## Solution:

Creating an open source application that could really assist in lost/found animals in BC and potentially relieve our call centre from some of these types of calls. Seeing as how Lost and Found are so highly searched on our site (2019 data) - top 3 searches within SPCA.
